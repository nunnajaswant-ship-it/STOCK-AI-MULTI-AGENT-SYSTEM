# STOCK-AI-MULTI-AGENT-SYSTEM
This project implements an intelligent automated stock trading system using Rational Agent Architecture and classical AI Search Algorithms including A* and Hill-Climbing. The trading system simulates BUY / SELL / HOLD decisions based on real-time or historical stock market data. The architecture compares the performance of four different intelligent agents — Simple Reflex, Model-Based, Goal-Based, and Utility-Based Agents — to analyze how decision-making strategies vary across agents.

The system demonstrates how heuristic search, utility evaluation, and multi-agent reasoning can improve trading accuracy, consistency, and profitability while reducing emotional bias.
